# MLB S26 Hackathon: Protein Fitness Prediction with Active Learning

This project builds an ML pipeline to predict single-mutation protein fitness (⁠ DMS_score ⁠) and recommend top mutations under a limited active-learning query budget.

## Repository Contents

### Core scripts

## Method Overview

Our final approach combines three components:

1.⁠ ⁠*Feature-engineered XGBoost baseline*
   - mutation position features
   - amino-acid one-hot encoding (WT + mutant)
   - physicochemical descriptors and deltas
   - BLOSUM62 substitution signal
   - local context features near mutation site

2.⁠ ⁠*Active learning integration*
   - merge returned query labels into training set each round
   - deduplicate by ⁠ mutant ⁠ to keep the latest label
   - use model score + uncertainty + diversity criteria for subsequent query generation

3.⁠ ⁠*Protein language model prior (ESM-1v) + ensembling*
   - compute per-mutant ⁠ plm_score ⁠ from log-probability difference
   - include PLM signal in ranking/selection
   - train multiple seeded final models and aggregate predictions (mean/std)

Primary model metric: *Spearman correlation* on validation split.

## Setup

Recommended: Python 3.10+ (3.11 also works).

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn biopython xgboost optuna torch transformers
